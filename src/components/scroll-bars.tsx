 * Moves the header, the tab bar and the "+" with the scroll: down a page they slide out as

 * settle the rest of the way, whichever way is nearer. They come back on a new page, at
 * the top of one, and at the end of one, where there is nothing left to read.
 *
 * Only scrolling moves them. A phone's browser shows and hides its own toolbar near the
 * end of a page, which changes the window's height and so where the end is; read as a
 * scroll, that jerked the bars half-way and back. A change of height moves nothing.
 *
 * It writes `--bars` on <html> (0 shown, 1 gone; the CSS is in globals.css), and
 * `data-bars`: "hidden" once all the way out, "live" while following the finger, when
 * the CSS turns the bars' own easing off so they do not lag behind it.
